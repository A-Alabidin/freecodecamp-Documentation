          The Cessna 172 Skyhawk is an American four-seat, single-engine, high
          wing, fixed-wing aircraft made by the Cessna Aircraft Company. First
          flown in 1955, more 172s have been built than any other aircraft. It
          was developed from the 1948 Cessna 170 but with tricycle landing gear
          rather than conventional landing gear. The Skyhawk name was originally
          used for a trim package, but was later applied to all
          standard-production 172 aircraft, while some upgraded versions were
          marketed as the Cutlass.

          he Cessna 172 started life as a tricycle landing gear variant of the
          taildragger Cessna 170, with a basic level of standard equipment. In
          January 1955, Cessna flew an improved variant of the Cessna 170, a
          Continental O-300-A-powered Cessna 170C with larger elevators and a
          more angular tailfin. Although the variant was tested and certified,
          Cessna decided to modify it with a tricycle landing gear, and the
          modified Cessna 170C flew again on June 12, 1955. To reduce the time
          and cost of certification, the type was added to the Cessna 170 type
          certificate as the Model 172. Later, the 172 was given its own type
          certificate. The 172 became an overnight sales success, and over 1,400
          were built in 1956, its first full year of production.

          From December 4, 1958, to February 7, 1959, Robert Timm and John Cook
          set the world record for (refueled) flight endurance in a used Cessna
          172, registration number N9172B. They took off from McCarran Airfield
          in Las Vegas, Nevada, and landed back at McCarran Airfield after 64
          days, 22 hours, 19 minutes and 5 seconds in a flight covering an
          estimated 150,000 miles, over 6 times further than flying around the
          world at the equator. The flight was part of a fund-raising effort for
          the Damon Runyon Cancer Fund. The aircraft is on display at the
          McCarran International Airport near Las Vegas, Nevada in the United
          States of America.

          Cessna has historically used model years similar to a U.S. auto
          manufacturer, with sales of new models typically starting a few months
          prior to the actual calendar year.

            The basic 172 appeared in November 1955 as the 1956 model and
            remained in production until replaced by the 172A in early 1960. It
            was equipped with a Continental O-300 145 hp (108 kW) six-cylinder,
            air-cooled engine and had a maximum gross weight of 2,200 lb (998
            kg). Introductory base price was US$8,995 and a total of 4,195 were
            constructed over the five years.

          <li class="variants">172A</li>
          <p>
            The 1960 model 172A introduced a swept-back tailfin and rudder, as
            well as float fittings. The price was US$9,450 and 1,015 were built.
          </p>
          <li class="variants">172B</li>
          <p>
            The 172B was introduced in late 1960 as the 1961 model and featured
            a shorter landing gear, engine mounts lengthened three inches (76
            mm), a reshaped cowling, and a pointed propeller spinner. For the
            first time, the "Skyhawk" name was applied to an available deluxe
            option package. This added optional equipment included full exterior
            paint to replace the standard partial paint stripes and standard
            avionics. The gross weight was increased to 2,250 lb (1,021 kg)

          <li class="variants">172C</li>
          <p>
            The 1962 model was the 172C. It brought to the line an optional
            autopilot and a key starter to replace the previous pull-starter.
            The seats were redesigned to be six-way adjustable. A child seat was
            made optional to allow two children to be carried in the baggage
            area. The 1962 price was US$9,895. A total of 889 172C models were
            produced.
          </p>
          <li class="variants">172D</li>
          <p>
            The 1963 172D model introduced the lower rear fuselage with a
            wraparound Omni-Vision rear window and a one-piece windshield. Gross
            weight was increased to 2,300 lb (1,043 kg), where it would stay
            until the 172P. New rudder and brake pedals were also added. 1,146
            172Ds were built.
